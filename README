Small adaptation of ox-md.el to make the exported markdown work
better for Leanpub (http://leanpub.com) publication.  It handles
footnotes, and makes source code separated from its output, and
the output does not display line numbers.  Html blocks are
ignored.

Missing:

- Tables should appear just as they are in org-mode.  Currently
  they are ignored.
- When using IDs for cross linking they should be taken advantage
  of.  Leanpub's markdown is supposed to be able to crosslink with
  ids.
