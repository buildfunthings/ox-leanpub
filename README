ox-leanpub.el

Org-mode backend to export Markdown for publication with Leanpub

Small adaptation of ox-md.el to make the exported markdown work better
for Leanpub (http://leanpub.com) publication.  It handles footnotes,
and makes source code separated from its output, and the output does
not display line numbers.  Html blocks are ignored.  Latex fragments
are formatted with {$$} {\$$}, and links work better than the default
(if you use IDs).

Missing:

- Tables should appear just as they are in org-mode.  Currently
  they are ignored.
- When using IDs for cross linking they should be taken advantage
  of.  Leanpub's markdown is supposed to be able to crosslink with
  ids.
